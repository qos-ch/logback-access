    <p>Provides a robust appender that serves logging events to remote clients</p>
    <p>The <a href="ServerSocketAppender.html"><code>ServerSocketAppender</code></a>
       listens on a configurable TCP port for connections from remote
       loggers.  Events that are delivered to the appender are serialized
       and sent to each connected remote logger.
